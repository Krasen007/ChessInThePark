# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical security vulnerabilities, production readiness issues, and bugs identified in the multiplayer chess application. The application currently has several security flaws, lacks proper error handling, and contains game logic bugs that need to be resolved before production deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Security Hardening

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be secure against common web vulnerabilities, so that user data and server resources are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server receives HTTP requests THEN it SHALL implement proper CORS configuration with specific allowed origins
2. WHEN the server handles user input THEN it SHALL validate and sanitize all input data to prevent injection attacks
3. WHEN the server processes socket connections THEN it SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks
4. WHEN the server serves static files THEN it SHALL set appropriate security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
5. WHEN the application runs in production THEN it SHALL not expose sensitive information in error messages
6. WHEN socket connections are established THEN the server SHALL implement connection limits per IP address

### Requirement 2: Production Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the application to be properly configured for production deployment, so that it runs reliably and securely in a production environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL use environment variables for all configuration settings
2. WHEN the application runs in production THEN it SHALL use proper logging with different log levels
3. WHEN the server encounters errors THEN it SHALL log them appropriately without exposing sensitive data
4. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL include proper health check endpoints
5. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL validate all required environment variables are present
6. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL implement graceful shutdown handling

### Requirement 3: Input Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust input validation and error handling, so that the application handles edge cases gracefully and prevents crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server receives move data THEN it SHALL validate all move parameters before processing
2. WHEN invalid data is received THEN the server SHALL return appropriate error responses
3. WHEN socket connections fail THEN the client SHALL handle reconnection gracefully
4. WHEN the game state becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL detect and recover appropriately
5. WHEN network errors occur THEN the client SHALL display user-friendly error messages
6. WHEN the server is overloaded THEN it SHALL reject new connections gracefully

### Requirement 4: Game Logic Bug Fixes

**User Story:** As a player, I want the chess game to follow proper chess rules and display correctly, so that I can enjoy a bug-free gaming experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pawn is promoted to queen and creates check THEN the game SHALL properly detect and display the check status
2. WHEN playing as black THEN the board orientation SHALL remain consistent throughout the game
3. WHEN moves are made THEN the server SHALL properly validate moves using complete chess rules
4. WHEN the game ends THEN all players SHALL be notified with consistent game state
5. WHEN castling is attempted THEN the server SHALL validate all castling conditions properly
6. WHEN en passant capture occurs THEN the captured pawn SHALL be removed from the board

### Requirement 5: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle multiple concurrent games efficiently, so that it can scale to support more users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple games are active THEN the server SHALL manage memory usage efficiently
2. WHEN players disconnect THEN the server SHALL clean up resources promptly
3. WHEN the server restarts THEN active games SHALL be handled gracefully
4. WHEN high traffic occurs THEN the server SHALL maintain responsive performance
5. WHEN games end THEN the server SHALL properly garbage collect game state
6. WHEN monitoring the application THEN performance metrics SHALL be available

### Requirement 6: Data Integrity and Consistency

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game state to remain consistent between client and server, so that moves are synchronized properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN moves are made THEN the client and server game states SHALL remain synchronized
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the game state SHALL be recoverable
3. WHEN players reconnect THEN they SHALL receive the current accurate game state
4. WHEN game history is displayed THEN it SHALL match the actual moves made
5. WHEN FEN strings are generated THEN they SHALL be valid and complete
6. WHEN board positions are compared THEN threefold repetition SHALL be detected correctly
