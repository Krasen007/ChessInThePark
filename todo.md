## User Experience (UX): Best Practices

- **Instant Gratification:** The moment someone scans the code, they should be taken directly to the game. No loading screens, no ads, and no sign-ups. The experience should be as immediate and frictionless as possible. The game should be built to load quickly on any mobile device, even with a slower internet connection.
- **Simple, Intuitive Interface:** The user interface should be clean and uncluttered. The chess board should take up most of the screen, and the pieces should be easy to move. Consider adding a small, simple "How to Play" section for beginners. Also, make sure the game works well in both portrait and landscape mode on a phone.
- **Encouraging Donations Subtly:** Since donations are your business model, you need to make it easy for people to contribute without being pushy. Integrate a small, unobtrusive "Donate" button in the corner of the screen that only appears after a game is completed. When a player taps it, a small pop-up could say something like, "Enjoy the game? Your support helps keep it free for everyone!" This makes the request part of the experience rather than a roadblock.
- **Create a "Spectator Mode"**: where people who scan the QR code can watch a game in progress.
- **Spectator Voting**: They could even vote for who they think will win, and if they guess correctly, they get a little digital "award" or a fun fact about Varna. This would encourage people to gather around the bench and engage with the game without even playing.
